Academic Research: Modules, Methods, and Presentations
This repository collects and organizes my academic research, with a focus on two areas:

Educational Modules: Designing, evaluating, and iterating on modular content for learning and teaching.

Personal Academic Work: Documenting my individual research presentations, reflective writing, and ongoing academic development.

It's meant to serve as both a working archive and a resource for anyone interested in research communication and curriculum development.
